# Dothat.js

Promise-Based Behavioural Facade DSL tools.

- Extendable Promise A+ compliant base Class
- aimed to define "Driver DSLs"
- which allow to pilot easily complex behavioural object
- by mixing Facade Method Chaining and Promises pipe pattern

Final aim is to provide easy Facade tools that hide technical details and/or targets inhomogeneities behind well choosed abstract DSLs.
It's the little sister of [Babelute.js](https://github.com/nomocas/babelute).

Lighweight (2.0 Ko minified gzipped) and so useful.

It has to be seen through Domain Specific Modeling (DSM) Approach, wich is the key of what is called the "Third Programming Revolution".

So alone, it comes with no usable DSLs. Only tools to define yours.
